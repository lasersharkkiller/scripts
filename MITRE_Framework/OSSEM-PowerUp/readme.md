A tool to assess data quality, built on top of the awesome OSSEM project.

Mission
Answer the question: I want to start hunting ATT&CK techniques, what log sources and events are more suitable?
Create transparency on the strengths and weaknesses of your log sources
Provide an easy way to evaluate your logs
OSSEM Power-up Overview
Power-up uses OSSEM Detection Data Model (DDM) as the foundation of its data quality assessment. The main reason for this is because it provides a structured way to correlate ATT&CK Data Sources, Common information model entities (CIM), and Data Dictionaries (events) with each other.

For those unfamiliar the DDM structure, here is a sample:

ATT&CK Data Source	Sub Data Source	Source Data Object	Relationship	Destination Data Object	EventID
Process monitoring	process creation	process	created	process	4688
Process monitoring	process creation	process	created	process	1
Process monitoring	process termination	process	terminated	-	4689
Process monitoring	process termination	process	terminated	-	5
As you can see each entry in the DDM defines a sub data source (scope) using abstract entities like process, user, file, etc. Each of these entries also contain an event ID, where the scope applies. You can read more about these entitites here.

In a nutshell, DDM entries play a major role on removing the complexity of raw events, by providing a scope that defines how a log source (data channels) can be consumed.

Data Quality Dimensions
Power-up assesses data quality score according to five distinct dimensions:

Dimension	Type	Description
Coverage	Data channel	How many devices or network segments are covered by the data channel
Timeliness	Data channel	How long does it take for the event to be available
Retention	Data channel	How long does the event remain available
Structure	Event	How complete is the event, if relevant fields are available
Consistency	Event	How standard are the event fields, if fields have been normalized
Every dimension is rated with a score between 0 (none) to 5 (excelent).

Coverage, Timeliness and Retention
These dimensions are tied to data channels, and propagate to all events provided by it.

Due to the nature of these dimensions, they must be rated manually, according to the specifities of the data channels.

Power-up uses resources/dcs.yml to define data channel and rate the dimensions:

data channel: sysmon
description: sysmon monitoring
coverage: 2
timeliness: 5
retention: 2
---
data channel: security
description: windows security auditing
coverage: 5
timeliness: 5
retention: 2
Structure
In order to calculate how complete the event structure is, power-up compares the data dictionary standard names with the fields of the entities (CIM) referenced in the DDM entry (source and destination).

Because not all entity fields are relevant (depends on the context), power-up uses the concept of profiles to select which fields need to match the data dictionary standard names. For example:

# OSSEM CIM Profile
process:
    - process_name
    - process_path
    - process_command_line
Note: There is an example profile in profiles/default.yml for you to play with.

The structure score is calculated with the following formula:

SCORE_PERCENT = (MATCHED_FIELDS / TOTAL_RELEVANT_FIELDS) * 100

For the sake of clarity, here is an example of how structure score is calculated: 

Note: Because Sysmon Event Id 1 data dictionary matches 100% of the relevant entity fields, the structure score will be rated as 5 (excelent).

The structure score is translated to the 0-5 scale in the following way:

Percentage	Score
0	0
1 to 25	1
26 to 50	2
51 to 75	3
76 to 99	4
100	5
Note: Depending on the use case (SIEM, Threat Hunting, Forensics), you can define different profiles so that you can rate your logs differently.

Consistency
To calculate consistency, power-up simply calculates the percentage of fields with a standard name in a data dictionary. Data dictionaries with a high number of fields mapped to a standard name are more likely to correlate with CIM entities.

The consistency score is calculated with the following formula:

SCORE_PERCENT = (STANDARD_NAME_FIELDS / TOTAL_FIELDS) * 100

The consistency score is translated to the 0-5 scale in the following way:

Percentage	Score
0	0
1 to 50	1
51 to 99	3
100	5

usage: powerup.py [-h] [-o OSSEM] [-y OSSEM_YAML] [-p PROFILE] [--excel]
                  [--elastic] [--yaml]

A tool to assess ATT&CK data source coverage, built on top of awesome OSSEM.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OSSEM, --ossem OSSEM
                        path to import OSSEM markdown
  -y OSSEM_YAML, --ossem-yaml OSSEM_YAML
                        path to import OSSEM yaml
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        path to CIM profile
  --excel               export OSSEM DDM to excel
  --elastic             export OSSEM data models to elastic
  --yaml                export OSSEM data models to yaml
  --layer               export OSSEM data models to navigator layer
As you can see power-up can consume OSSEM data from two different formats:

OSSEM markdown - The native format of OSSEM when you clone from git.
OSSEM yaml - A sumarized format of OSSEM, only the data fields and a few metadata. You can power-up to convert OSSEM markdown to yaml.
Currently, Power-up exports OSSEM output to:

Yaml - Creates OSSEM structures in yaml, in the output/ folder
Excel - Creates an OSSEM DDM table, enriched with the data quality scores, in the ouput/ folder
Elastic - Creates an OSSEM structure in elastic, the indexes are as follows:
ossem.ddm - OSSEM DDM table, enriched with the data quality scores
ossem.cim - OSSEM CIM entries
ossem.dds - OSSEM Data Dictionaries
ossem.dcs - OSSEM Data Channels
Note: if no profile file path is specified power-up uses profiles/default.yml by default.

Exporting to YAML

The goal of exporting/importing to/from YAML is to facilitate OSSEM customization. Chances are that the first you will do is create your own data dictionaries, and then add new DDM entries, so YAML will make updates easier.

Note 1: modify resources/config.yml to instruct power-up about the file names for the correct structures. Then you just need to place then in a folder and pass to OSSEM_YAML argument.

Note 2: power-up does not parse the entire OSSEM objects to YAML, only the data fields and some metadata (i.e. description). The reason for this is that I wanted to keep the YAML object as lean as possible, just with the data you need to assess data quality.
